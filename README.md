Here is a quick overview of what has been my web journey:
-When I was 15 I got started with websites by building my geocities site that had just photos of me and my friends, 
a really simple project but this was before social media so it was pretty cool to have some photos online.
-At 18 I helped manage a website that sold cellphone accessories, really basic managing, uploading photos, descriptions, etc.
-At 22 or so I built a smaller Joomla site, the purpose of this site was to upload articles for a local magazine.
-Later on I built a WordPress site here and there, just smaller 5 page websites for local business.
-Helped manage a magento site, this was a larger ecommerce site, I worked with the lead developer to bulk update products in this site with 1,500+ SKUs
-Currently at 34 (In 2022) I am a project manager in a marketing agency, I currently work in the web department, helping launch websites and helping bridge
the gap between designer, developer, and clients. 
-At the moment I'm trying to review html, css and learn some javascript, python, git, bash while I'm at it.
